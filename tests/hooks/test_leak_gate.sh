# Every token is ASSEMBLED AT RUNTIME. That is not a workaround: the fixtures for
# this test ARE the shapes the gate blocks, so writing them literally would make
# this file uncommittable — and would be exactly the leak the gate exists to stop.
#
# Both directions matter and both have regressed:
#   too strict: a container image tag blocked every docs commit
#   too loose : a file path with a line number was exempted as an "image ref",
#               so a real address in pasted grep output would have sailed through
